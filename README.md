# PDE_finite_difference
Collection of simple Python scripts for simulating some interesting PDEs via finite-difference schemes. Mostly for pedagogical purposes (creating nice visuals
for talks or classes), will probably add Jupyter versions in the future. 

Requires numpy, scipy, and the [cmocean colourmap library](https://github.com/matplotlib/cmocean) (for plotting).
